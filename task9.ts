//12 Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, 
// print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, 
// but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names2 = ["ali","ahmad","daina","brouce","clark"]

for(let a = 0;a<names2.length;a++){
    console.log(`hello there! ${names2[a]}`)
